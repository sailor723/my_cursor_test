# My Cursor Test

A test repository created with Cursor to demonstrate GitHub integration capabilities.

## Overview

This repository serves as a demonstration of how to create and manage GitHub repositories programmatically using AI assistants and API integrations. It contains sample files to showcase basic functionality.

## Repository Contents

- `README.md` - This documentation file
- `hello.txt` - A simple text file with a greeting message
- `main.py` - A Python script that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 100

## Features

- GitHub repository creation and management
- README file with markdown formatting
- Basic Python script demonstration
- Text file handling

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Git installed on your local machine
- A GitHub account
- Python 3.x for running the script

### Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine:
